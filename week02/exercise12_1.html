    <h2>Inception (2010)</h2>
    <p>Directed by Christopher Nolan, "Inception" is a sci-fi thriller that delves into the world of shared dreams. Dom
      Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a skilled thief who specializes in the art of extraction, stealing secrets from within
      the subconscious during the dream state. He is given a chance at redemption when offered a seemingly impossible
      task: to plant an idea in someone's mind, known as inception. The film explores themes of reality, memory, and the
      power of the mind.
