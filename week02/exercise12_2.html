    <h2>The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</h2>
    <p>Based on a novella by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont, "The Shawshank Redemption" follows the story
      of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in Shawshank
      State Penitentiary. Over the years, he befriends fellow inmate Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and earns the
      respect of his fellow prisoners. The film is a poignant tale of hope, friendship, and perseverance in the face of
      adversity.
